Linux can be managed through the command line interface. However, most end users prefere using a graphical user interface (GUI).<br>

The X Window System is a portable, network-based display system. It provides the foundation to building a GUI and consists of two major pieces of software: a server which accepts requests to do things to a display and the low-level C library called Xlib.

It allows to run applications on windows, move windows around the screen and click on items.

- The X Server is executed in the local machine and is responsible for graphically drawing windows on the screen, as well as managing the keyboard and mouse.
- Xlib is the library that programs use to interact with the X Server, providing functions for creating windows, handling events, drawing graphics, and managing input devices. Programs written with Xlib functions are called clients.
- The X Clients are applications that connect to the X Server, remote or locally, and make requests for it . They access and use display resources. Each application looks different, because X does not impose any policy on how the GUI should operate.  
- The Window Manager customize how the windows look, behave and stack along with each other. It is a component of a desktop environment, but can be used alone. It cames barebone, which allows for customization and flexibility. It is just another client using Xlib which can contact and interact with a running X server.
- The Desktop Environment (optional) adds tools and utilities such as start menu, taskbar, icons, screen locker, etc. It dictates how the GUI looks.

MiniLibX is a library based on Xlib, which contains functions for interacting with an X server. It is meant for beginners to learn the basics of graphics development.
